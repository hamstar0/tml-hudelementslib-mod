This is a library mod for mods to define HUD-space UI elements that are able to be repositioned freely (alt+click to drag). Elements smartly avoid overlapping each other and vanilla HUD elements (if desired).

Note: This mod will not do anything without another mod to make use of it (hence, a library mod).
